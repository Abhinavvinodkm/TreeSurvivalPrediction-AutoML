* Data Exploration: Conducting an initial analysis to understand the data features and characteristics.
* Data Preparation: Cleaning and preprocessing the data to make it suitable for modeling.
* Baseline Model Selection and Training: Choosing and training a basic model to establish a performance benchmark.
* Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing the model's hyperparameters to improve its performance.
* Statistical Comparison: Comparing the model before and after hyperparameter optimization to assess the statistical significance of the improvements.
